*_The Perfect Auth combo_* *2024*


I built a simple application which might serve as a reference to futher authentication more like a template to make authentication of users seemlessly eaiser..


By combing the power of Authentication provided by Better-Auth the seemless upload feature of uploadthing and using Prisma as an ORM for my Database (Supabase), the mailing power of resend using some shadcn components you can have your users authenticated and routed to the dashboard instantly


with protected routes and actions made to fetch users data and update them.......... I must say development just got easier, faster and way too good to be true..... our fore father ought to be Jealous

add your 

DATABASE_URL
DIRECT_URL
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
BETTER_AUTH_URL
RESEND_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN


run 	
	pnpm install 
 	pnpx prisma generate
  	pnpx @better-auth/cli generate


   to get started have fun!!!!!
